# wordle
 A Text based wordle game similar to that made by NewYork Times Magazine. The game randomly picks a five letter word called the Wordle and the user goal is to figure it out in the specific tries they get. However this one comes with two differences. First the player can choose difficulty levels(level 1 = 10 tries, level 2 = 5 tries, level 3 = 3 tries), and second, the user cannot guess the same word again.
