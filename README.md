# wordle
 A Text based wordle game similar to that made by NewYork Times Magazine. The game randomly picks a five letter word called the Wordle and the user goal is to figure it out in the specific tries they get. However this one comes with two differences. First the player can choose difficulty levels(level 1 = 10 tries, level 2 = 5 tries, level 3 = 3 tries), and second, the user cannot guess the same word again.

# Upcoming Release:
I am very proud with this work. I will keep on improving it. The next release Is going to be a GUI based Wordle. I still have to decide on wether I am going to use the pygame module like dodger or make it into a cross platform app with react native. altough more work, think the later sounds perfect. Stay Tuned!
